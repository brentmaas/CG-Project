Final project for the course Computer Graphics

To compile, simple execute 'make'. Compilation and execution worked on computer 0009768 in 302.
Execution requires the folder 'resources' and it's contents next to the executable.

'make run' or './CGProjectBrentMaas' will have the program run as usual.

'make rundebug' or './CGProjectBrentMaas debug' will have the program run in a 1200x800 window
which will print fps, time factor, and whether or not it's paused in the title.

Arrow keys or left-clicked mouse dragging: move camera.
R: Reset to new initial state.
K: Trigger all available novas.
